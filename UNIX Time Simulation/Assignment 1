CS 621 – Operating System Design 
Programming Assignment #1 

 

You are to use the UNIX environment to write two C programs as follows:  

Simulate the UNIX utility time that shows the time taken by a program. Your command line syntax should be as follows: (mytime command). This program should invoke a program which gets the CPU time, forks a child to run command and when the child returns gets the CPU time again and prints the difference between the two times. You do not need to re-invent the concept of time. You can use a built-in Unix/Linux timer utility to keep the time. 

 

Use sigaction and pause to write a function that simulates the sleep function. DO NOT simply write a wrapper program to call the UNIX/Linux “sleep” function. 

Both programs MUST be written in C on UNIX or Linux. You might need to create a Virtual Machine environment to program in since this program cannot be written on an MS Windows computer. It can be written in Terminal on a MacBook.
